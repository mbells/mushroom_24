- implement animation in the color domain
- add 2 energy sources
- allow source control from keyboard
    - initial impluse when touch changes (both low and high)
    - constant pulses afterwards at a given frequency
- lower attenuation when both inputs are touched
- implement magical synergy effect: 2 waves interact and create a spontaneous pulse in 3rd color domain

## Arduino
- convert to int arithmetic
- create Arduino sketch
